                This is my first portfolio, I am currently in school to become a
                beginning web developer. I have been loving every minute of this
                process. It started off with HTML which allows me to structure
                the content, text, images, and links, in a meaningful way to my
                website. Once I had a concept of how things work using HTML, we
                then moved on to CSS. CSS lets me style and design my website,
                while also giving me the ability to control colors, layouts, and
                fonts, which helped me turn a plain webpage into something much
                more appealing. I am so excited as we have began to start
                getting into Javascript recently.

    <h2 class="container">Consistancy & Determination</h2>
    <div class="container text-center">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          Staying consistent in life’s challenges is important to me. When I
          stick to my goals, even when things get tough, I build a certain
          confidence and strength that helps me handle future difficulties more
          effectively. Consistency reminds me that growth isn’t always
          immediate, but it is still happening. When I'm consistant it helps me
          stay dedicated, and focused, even when the path ahead is unknown.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          Even when distractions or setbacks try to pull me off course. I’ve
          learned that it’s not about instant success, but about showing up
          consistently and putting in the effort, no matter how tough things
          get. When I’m dedicated, I don’t let fear or doubt hold me back. Now I
          see them as part of the journey. Every step, brings me closer to where
          I want to be, and that’s what keeps me committed. Dedication reminds
          me that nothing worthwhile comes easy, but it is always worth the
          effort.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          I can’t wait to step into a job where it doesn’t feel like work at
          all, but more like a chance to grow and make a difference. I know that
          if I continue to pursue coding, every challenge will feel worth it,
          and the successes will be that much sweeter. Even before I’m
          officially finished with school, I feel a connection to it, and I’m
          eager to make my passion a reality. The thought of turning something I
          have grown to love through experience into my career makes the hard
          work now feel more like an investment in my future happiness.
