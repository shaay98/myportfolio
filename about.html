        <p class="card-text">
          I am a mother and a child of God before anything else. Spending time
          with my children is very important to me. I would do anything to see
          them happy. Overall, I am genuinely a very nice person and my
          intentions are always well. I can’t help but to feel excited about
          what’s to come. I know there will be challenges ahead, but I’m ready
          to face them. I’ve learned so much in so little time, not just in
          terms of skills, but about my own ability to overcome challenges I
          didn't know I could. Finding a job, after stepping into this new
          chapter, is just around the corner, and I’m filled with confidence
          that I’m ready to make my mark. This is the beginning of something
          amazing, and I’m excited for all the opportunities that are about to
          unfold with this new experience. I can't wait to grow in this career.

          I’ve learned to embrace the process of trial and error, understanding
          that mistakes are part of the journey and they often lead to the
          biggest moments of growth. I’ve become more comfortable with tools
          like Github. Slowly, I’ve learned to solve problems more effectively
          with the help of my instructor and TA's, to break down hard tasks into
          simple steps. Looking back, it’s amazing to see how much I’ve learned,
          and I’m excited to continue growing and perfecting my skills as I take
          on more challenging projects. Every day, I’m a little closer to
          becoming the developer I aspire to be.
